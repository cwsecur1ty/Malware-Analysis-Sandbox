# Setting Up a Malware Analysis Sandbox with Windows 10 ISO and FlareVM
In this project, I set out to create a malware analysis sandbox using a Windows 10 ISO and FlareVM. This documentation details my journey through the setup process, sharing the steps I took and the challenges I encountered along the way. By following this account, you’ll gain insight into how to establish a secure and effective environment for malware analysis. Whether you’re looking to replicate my setup or simply curious about the process, this narrative provides a firsthand look at building a robust sandbox for studying malicious software.
# Step by Step
1. Pre-Installation
    - I prepared a Windows 10 ISO from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10), I used the Windows 10 setup tool to create a .ISO installation media.
    - Once this had been created, I uploaded the .ISO file into my ProxMox server's ISO images.
2. Configuring and Isolating the Sandbox
    - Now I don't want the sandbox to have any chance to harm anything else on the network, so I set it up with:
      - 'VirtIO (paravirtualized)' as the network model.
      - Isolated bridge for malware analysis VM.
      - Custom firewall rules for the VM.
